# Summary:
#    A queue is called a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data 
#    structure. It can equally be called Last-In-Last-Out 
#   (LILO). A queue is an ordered collection of elements 
#    where the client can remove elements from only one 
#    end (the front) and add access to the other (the back)
